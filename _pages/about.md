I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Virginia, supervised by Dr. [Hongning Wang](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/). My research is in statistical machine learning, with a focus on Bayesian and probabilistic graphical model to learn computational user representations for recommender systems using multi-modality user-generated data. Here is my latest [CV]((http://louise-lulin.github.io/files/CV.pdf)).
